# Learn GIT / GITHUB
Learnig how to use Git / Github

Something about myself, they say.
Ok. I am from Portugal, i am sales manager in a tech company but my academic road was intended to be a programer or a system analyst.
Sales speack louder then coding so 20 twenty plus years forward in a "branch of life" i drop the coding and ride the sales road.
But the coding "bug" the genetics of writing code, creating something with code remains until now, and its time to get a new hobby and i choose learn or relearn to code.
